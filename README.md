## Provingly Correct Optimizations on Intrinsically Typed Expressions

Ongoing research towards my Master's thesis at Utrecht University.

- `src`: Agda code
- `project-report`: Technical report on a first step, the implementation and correctness proof of *dead binding elimination*
  - submitted PDF only, source code is preserved on [a separate branch](https://github.com/mheinzel/correct-optimisations/tree/main/tyde22)
- `tyde22`: Extended abstract and slides for [my talk at TyDe 2022](https://icfp22.sigplan.org/details/tyde-2022-papers/11/Provingly-Correct-Optimisations-on-Intrinsically-Typed-Expressions-Extended-Abstract)
- `thesis-proposal`: Currently in progress
