\section{Introduction}

When writing a compiler for a functional programming language,
one of the core considerations usually is the treatment of binders and variables.
\Draft{many possible representations (string, de Bruijn)}
\Draft{naive implementation is not scope-safe, therefore partial}

A well-known technique when using dependently typed programming languages such as Agda
\cite{norell2007agda}
is to define an intrinsically typed syntax tree \cite{augustsson1999intrinsic}.
\Draft{correct by construction, scope- and type-safe, total evaluator}
This construction has featured in several papers exploring
compilation to different target languages
\cite[supplemental material]{pickard2021calculating}
as well as basic operations like renaming and substitution
\cite{allais2018universe}.

However, there has been little focus on performing optimizations on the syntax tree.
\Draft{optimizations are important, correctness often not trivial}

While the search for optimization opportunities is mostly unaffected
by the presence of additional type information,
performing any transformation of the program now comes with the burden of
convincing the compiler of its type- and scope-safety.
\Draft{especially when related to binders}
\Draft{also, analysis results need to be in form that allows proving correctness}

For any given set of language features, there is a large number of potentially relevant optimizations.
We will consider a very simple expression language with binders,
making the optimizations widely applicable.
\Todo{Not sure how to plug the Nielsen book here.}
\Todo{This reads a bit awkwardly, maybe there's a better justification.}

As a specific instance, we present an implementation of \emph{dead binding elimination}
by defining a syntax tree annotated with variable usage information.
We further show that the optimization is semantics-preserving,
independently of how the annotations are obtained.
\Todo{
  The last bit does not seem clear.
  In LVA, the annotated expression type is expressive enough
  that the definition of \I{analyse} is basically forced,
  but generally it could have more freedom, e.g. to use heuristics for inlining,
  and its implementation would not matter for optimization correctness.
}


\section{Dead Binding Elimination}
\Todo{Change how it's split into sections and subsections?}

\subsection{An intrinsically typed expression languages with binders}

We define a simple typed expression language with binding.
Instead of freely allowing function values to be created (using $\lambda$-abstraction) and applied,
variables are introduced using let-bindings.
This keeps the language first-order and simplifies parts of the analysis.

Since the optimizations we are interested in relate to variables and binders only,
the choice of possible values and additional primitive operations on them is mostly arbitrary.
For simplicity, we choose the values in our language to be natural numbers or Booleans
and include addition as an example of a binary operator.

\Todo{Is the above all relevant? Shorten?}

\Todo{Show Agda definition of $\Expr$?}

In Agda, the type of expressions $\Expr$ is indexed by its return type ($\tau : \U$)
and \emph{context} ($\Gamma : \Ctx$).
Each free variable is a de Bruijn index into the context and acts as a proof that
the context contains an element of the matching type.
This allows the definition of a total evaluator
using a matching \emph{environment}:

\begin{align*}
  \I{eval} &: \I{Expr}\ \Gamma\ \tau \to \I{Env}\ \Gamma \to \Interpret{\tau}
\end{align*}
%(\texttt{eval : Expr $\Gamma$ $\tau$ $\to$ Env $\Gamma$ $\to$ $\Interpret{\tau}$}).
%($\texttt{eval} : \Expr \Gamma \tau \to \Env \Gamma \to \Interpret{\tau}$).

\subsection{Sub-contexts}

Note that an expression is not forced to make use of the whole context it has access to.
Specifically, a let-binding introduces a new element into the context, but it might never be used.

\Todo{cite \emph{A correct-by-construction conversion to combinators}? It's quite similar.}

To reason about the \emph{sub-contexts} of a context that are live (actually used),
we use \emph{order-preserving embeddings} (OPE) \cite{chapman2009type}.

\begin{align*}
  &\K{data}\ \I{Subset} : \I{Ctx} \to \I{Set}\ \K{where}          \\
  &\ \ \ \ \I{Empty} : \I{Subset}\ []                                    \\
  &\ \ \ \ \I{Drop}  : \I{Subset}\ \Gamma \to \I{Subset}\ (\tau :: \Gamma)  \\
  &\ \ \ \ \I{Keep}  : \I{Subset}\ \Gamma \to \I{Subset}\ (\tau :: \Gamma)
\end{align*}

Such a sub-context describe a context themselves
($\Floor{\_} : \I{Subset}\ \Gamma \to \I{Ctx}$),
but contains more information than that.
For example, the witnesses of a binary relation $\subseteq$ on sub-contexts are unique,
as opposed to e.g. $[\I{INT}] \subseteq [\I{INT}, \I{INT}]$.

From now on, we will only consider expressions
$\I{Expr}\ \Floor{\Delta}\ \tau$ in some sub-context $\Delta : \I{Subset}\ \Gamma$.
Initially, we take $\Delta = \I{all}\ \Gamma$ to be the complete sub-context of the original context.

\subsection{Live Variable Analysis}

Now we can annotate each expression with its \emph{live variables},
the sub-context $\Delta' \subseteq \Delta$ that is really used.
To that end, we define annotated expressions $\I{LiveExpr}\ \Delta\ \Delta'$.
While $\Delta$ is treated as before, $\Delta'$ now only contains live variables,
starting with the variables, where it forms a singleton sub-context.

\begin{align*}
  \K{data}\ \I{LiveExpr}& : (\Delta\ \Delta' : \I{Subset}\ \Gamma) (\tau : \I{U}) \to Set\ \K{where} \\
  \I{Let}
    :\ &\I{LiveExpr}\ \Delta\ \Delta_1\ \sigma \to  \\
       &\I{LiveExpr}\ (\I{Keep}\ \Delta)\ \Delta_2\ \tau \to  \\
       &\I{LiveExpr}\ \Delta\ (\Delta_1 \cup \I{pop}\ \Delta_2)\ \tau \\
  \ldots&
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
  \I{analyse}
    &:  \I{Expr}\ \Floor{\Delta}\ \tau
    \to \Existential{\Delta'}{\I{Subset}\ \Gamma}\ \I{LiveExpr}\ \Delta\ \Delta'\ \tau \\
  \I{forget}
    &:  \I{LiveExpr}\ \Delta\ \Delta'\ \tau
    \to \I{Expr}\ \Floor{\Delta}\ \tau
\end{align*}

The only requirement on \I{analyse} we have is that we can forget the annotations again,
with $\I{forget} \circ \I{analyse} \equiv \I{id}$.

\subsection{Transformation}

Note that we can evaluate $\I{LiveExpr}$ directly, with the main difference
that in the $\I{Let}$-case we match on $\Delta_2$ to distinguish whether the bound variable is live.
If it is not, we directly evaluate the body, ignoring the bound declaration.
This \emph{optimized semantics} shows that we can do a similar program transformation
and will be useful in its correctness proof.

\begin{align*}
  \I{dbe}
    &:  \I{LiveExpr}\ \Delta\ \Delta'\ \tau
    \to \I{Expr}\ \Floor{\Delta'}\ \tau
\end{align*}

\Todo{
  Not sure if and how to show code here.
  It's a bit verbose with the pattern matching on $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ and \I{injExpr}.
}
\Todo{
  Mention renamings (\I{injExpr}) that are necessary.
}

\subsection{Correctness}

We want to show that dead binding elimination preserves semantics:
$\I{eval} \circ \I{dbe} \circ \I{analyse} \equiv \I{eval}$.
Since we know that $\I{forget} \circ \I{analyse} \equiv \I{id}$,
it is sufficient to show the following:

\begin{align*}
  \I{eval} \circ \I{dbe} \equiv \I{eval} \circ \I{forget}
\end{align*}

The proof gets simpler if we split it up using the optimized semantics.

\begin{align*}
  \I{eval} \circ \I{dbe} \equiv \I{evalLive} \equiv \I{eval} \circ \I{forget}
\end{align*}

\Todo{details about proof statement, generalization of environment used etc.}

Both proofs work inductively on the expression, with most cases being a straight-forward congruence.
The interesting case is \I{Let}, \ldots

\Todo{continue}

\subsection{Iterating the Optimization}

Removing a binding can remove the only usages of a variable.
This makes another binding dead, allowing further optimization.
While this could be avoided in this particular case using \emph{strong live variable analysis},
it is common to iterate optimizations until no further improvement is achieved.

Such an iteration is not structurally recursive \ldots

\Draft{We know it terminates, num bindings decreases and positive}
